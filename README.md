The code file `main.py` is a comprehensive script that includes various tools for interacting with the file system, generating documentation, and utilizing a local Hugging Face model for text generation. The script is designed to be used in a project context, where it processes files, generates documentation, and integrates with a local LLM backend. The code is structured to handle both file operations and documentation generation, leveraging the LangGraph framework for agent-based interaction.

The main functionalities of the script include:

1. **File System Tools**: The script provides tools for listing directories, creating directories, reading and writing files, and reading all files in a project directory. These tools are implemented using standard Python libraries such as `os` and `pathlib`.

2. **Documentation Generation**: The script includes a `read_all_files_relative` function that recursively reads all files in a project directory, and a `main` function that processes these files to generate a `README.md` and `llms.txt` documents. The documentation is generated based on the content of the files, following specific formatting and structure guidelines.

3. **LLM Integration**: The script uses a local Hugging Face model (`microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct`) for text generation. It is integrated with the LangGraph framework to create an agent that can handle complex tasks, such as generating documentation based on the project's file content.

4. **Command Line Arguments**: The script accepts command line arguments to specify the project directory, model name, and device for inference. This allows the user to customize the behavior of the script according to their specific needs.

5. **Output Handling**: The script generates and prints the output of the documentation generation process, including the `README.md` and `llms.txt` files, along with a summary of the generated content.

The code is designed to be modular and extensible, with the ability to integrate with different LLM backends (such as OpenAI) and to handle various file operations. The use of the LangGraph framework allows for a more sophisticated and interactive approach to documentation generation, enabling the script to handle complex workflows and state management.

The script is intended to be used in a project context, where it processes files
